# My tests on nouveau show terrible slowdown.

# GLX backend: Use MESA_copy_sub_buffer to do partial screen update.

# May break VSync and is not available on some drivers.
# Overrides --glx-copy-from-front.

# Probably could improve performance on rapid window content changes, but is known to break things on some drivers (LLVMpipe).

# GLX backend: GLX buffer swap method we assume.
# Could be undefined (0), copy (1), exchange (2), 3-6, or buffer-age (-1).
# undefined is the slowest and the safest, and the default value.
# copy is fastest, but may fail on some drivers,
# 2-6 are gradually slower but safer (6 is still faster than 0).
# Usually, double buffer means 2, triple buffer means 3.
# buffer-age means auto-detect using GLX_EXT_buffer_age, supported by some drivers.
# Useless with --glx-use-copysubbuffermesa.
# Partially breaks --resize-damage.
# Defaults to undefined.
